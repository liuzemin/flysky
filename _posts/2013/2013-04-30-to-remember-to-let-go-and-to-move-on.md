If I learned something this year, that must be being more active and stronger, both mentally and physically.

**To remember** those who have stepped into my life, some of them made me happy and some of them made me angry but pushed me forward.

**To let go** of all those unhappy moments. Whatever happened this year, they just helped me to be me today. Today, I can just let go with a smile. I am just so mature and elegant.

**To move on** with all your support behind me. I am not afraid of the unknown future anymore. I know that everything could be better.

銘記，釋懷，繼續前行！
